      <h1 class="page-title">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <article><p>UKGovHack will be following the Hack Code of Conduct as set out at <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/">hackcodeofconduct.org</a>.</p>
<p>All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at UKGovHack are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The organising team will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
<h2 id="the-quick-version">The Quick Version</h2>
<p>The team behind UKGovHack is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at UKGovHack, or in any online channels or social media associated with the event. UKGovHack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organising team.</p>
<h2 id="the-less-quick-version">The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at UKGovHack are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the UKGovHack organising team immediately.</p>
<p>The UKGovHack team will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the UKGovHack organising team may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hack, or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at UKGovHack to ensure safety, serenity and quite simply the most awesome event for all.</p>
